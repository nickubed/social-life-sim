A Social Life Simulator Game

## A Phaser Game about Emoji Matching

Welcome to Social Life Simulator! The game where you match emoji to prove your social competence and deceive people around you into thinking you have a rampant social life!

### Instructions

Be the envy of all of your real-life friends as you simulate your way through the bustling social life that your friends wish you had!
Match falling emoji to your player-controlled emoji by using the directional keys, and quantify your social aptitude by setting a personal high-score!

### Initial Configuration

1. Fork this project into your system via github!
2. Run npm start to launch this baby to your browser.

### Built With:

```shell
Phaser
JavaScript
HTML
CSS
```

### The Process

> Development on Social Life Simulator started on **November 27th, 2019** while enrolled in General Assembly's SEI program.
Day one development included wireframing and planning game flow, and a rough game field and blank entities were added to the game board.
Many global variables were declared, with many to be added and removed as development proceeded.

> On **November 29th, 2019** image assets added to the game. This included three of the emoji used in the game, as well as the design and implementation of the gameboard.

> On **November 30th, 2019** an array was added to handle spawn coordinates, preventing the spawns from occuring wherever they wanted to on the page.
This allowed for a much more predictable and controlled game-flow. A scoring and life system was added, but could only be viewed via console.

> On **December 1st, 2019** logic was added to handle an increase in spawns, as well as a function that allowed the player & computer to access the emoji array, and allowed additional emoji to be added to the array.

> On **December 2nd, 2019** a fifth emoji was added to the array, added score, level, and life display to the game screen!!

> On **December 3rd, 2019** added some polish via CSS, realized that MVP had been met, and tuned math to result in a significantly more playable game. Added sounds.

### If I had more time I would...

> Further smooth out the difficulty curve, recruit playtesters to see if actual play time reflects theoretical play time. Much of what I had struggled with, math-wise, was likely due to only having one play-tester, and it was me.

> Add single-use emoji such as a "bomb" which instantly clears the screen, but can only be earned when specific factors are met.

> Better handling of game-ending

> Learn way more about phaser's in-built methods. I feel like I could have expanded the depth of this game had I had a better understanding of the depth of Phaser. Phaser's limitations were a far larger barrier than I had anticipated, going in, so I would like to better tailor the game experience to fit within Phaser's intended use.
